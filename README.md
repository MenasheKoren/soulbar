# soulbar

SoulBar is a webapp chatbot. Users that are bored being stuck in lockdown or stressed out while working from home with no one to talk to can share their problems with a non-judgmental virtual bartender. With the help of SoulBar users can bare their souls without worrying that the boss will find out.

The user is able to converse with the chatbot according the dispensation of whom they are speaking with, including Sympathetic Sam, Motivating Mary, or Wise Wendy.

This app is meant to be fun, and hopefully help the user let off some steam at the same time.

This was done using Django, and Python to make the chatbot.

This is a work in progress, with hopes that it should be fully functional soon.
